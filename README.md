# Quadratic Equation Solver - Java Assignment 005

**Instructions:**
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository locally to your machine.
3. Create a new branch named Feature01.

## Assignment

**Objective:**
Create a file named `src/Quadratic.java` and write a program that calculates the roots of the quadratic equation:
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
using the quadratic formula:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**Requirements:**
- Prompt the user to input integers for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
- Compute the two solutions for \(x\) using the quadratic formula.
- Display the results.

**Additional Instructions:**
- Your program should handle inputs where there is only one or no solution. Avoid division by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.
- Validate all inputs to prevent input mismatch exceptions.
- Display specific error messages that include details about invalid input.

## Submission
Follow these steps for submission:
1. Create a Feature01 branch of your code if you haven't already.
2. Commit your working code for the quadratic equation solver to your local copy/Feature01 branch.
3. Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e., GitHub: Feature01 -> origin/Feature01).
4. Issue a Pull request to my instructor repo.
5. **Make sure to COPY the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab/assignment in Canvas.**
